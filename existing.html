                Before our first meeting with our partner from FORK, we wanted to see what was already out there.
                However, after meeting and discussing these existing solutions, we learned more about the requirements
                and constraints of our project, which helped us refine our approach.

                        <p>According to the <a href="https://www.stormwatersystems.com/stormx-netting-trash-trap">stormwatersystems</a>, 
                            "Engineered to directly tackle waterway pollution, StormX™, 
                            is designed to capture debris and prevent it from entering larger bodies of water, ensuring an
                            effective and environmentally friendly solution."
                            </br></br>
                            After showing this to our partner, she shared with us the history of efforts from the organisation and the town council to clean up the River Kelvin.
                            She said that this was a good product. However, it was not suitable for them as it needs to be installed and manually emptied, and FORK
                            being a volunteer organization, do not have the resources to run and maintain it. This also does not reduce the littering problem
                            that happens around the River Kelvin.

                            We also mentioned this existing solution to our partner, and though it had some better features than StormX, such as
                            it being automated and water-powered, there was still the problem of resources like funding needed to run and maintain it.
                            It also does not reduce the littering problem that happens around the River Kelvin.

                    Researching existing solutions and analysing them with our partner was an important
                    step in our project. It helped us understand the limitations of current solutions 
                    and the specific needs of FORK and River Kelvin. This knowledge guided us in designing a 
                    solution prototype that is not only effective but also practical and aligned with the goals of FORK.
                    We are now ready to move forward with our prototype development, incorporating the 
                    insights gained from this research phase.
